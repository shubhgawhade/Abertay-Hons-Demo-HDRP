Mariano: Why Paulie?; 
Mariano: Why does the boss want me dead?;
Mariano: Tell me what is it that I’ve done to deserve this 
and I won’t fight you anymore.;
Mariano: I’m kinda dead anyways.;
Paulie: I love you Mariano.;
Paulie: I couldn’t have asked for a better brother.;
Paulie: But this is business, 
and it’s hurting our weekly cap.;
Mariano: BECAUSE OF WHAT!?;
Mariano: I’ve always done things by the book 
and I’ve never spoken against the boss.;
Paulie: It’s not that Mariano it’s about that fucking. . .;
Paulie: I don’t know if I can tell.;
Mariano: Why can’t you tell?;
Mariano: Just tell me and I will disappear.;
Mariano: You can just say the job’s done when you get back.;
Paulie: YOU’RE SUPPOSED TO BE DEAD!;
Paulie: *sigh*;
Paulie: You know you'll never get it from me friend.;
Mariano: Regardless of if you tell me or not
 I’m going to figure it out myself.;
Mariano: Then trust me, you won’t ever find me again.;
Mariano: Farewell Paulie.;
