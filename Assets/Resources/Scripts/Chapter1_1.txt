Mariano : Oh i miei ochhi! Who do we have here?! ( Mariano’s paranoia gets worse, he thinks that this is a distraction)
Paulie : Your away-from-city goomah! HAHAHA! ( Paulie has a slightly awkward laugh not like his natural self )
Luca : HAHAHAH! ( Supports Paulie’s terrible joke with a laugh, Luca rarely ever laughs at Paulie’s joke, only Mariano does to avoid questioning as Paulie is also Capo)
Lauren : Hey Mariano!  
Mariano : Lauren what are you doing here? Shouldn’t you be at the strip club doing your thing?
Lauren : You guys are late, I’ve been here for half an hour now!
Mariano : Wait how was she here before us? And why?
Paulie : You’ll know when she wears that sexy dress we got her
Luca : He’s right! Baby why don’t you go change in the bathroom real quick huh?
Mariano : No she stays…I…uh…like what she’s wearing it’s fine.
Luca : Don’t worry bout it, she’ll be back to suck the soul outta you!
Mariano : Hey Lauren, come here for a sec. Guys I thought this was our little get together! ( Calls Lauren close )
Luca : Paulie show him the special..
Mariano : FUCK!
