Mariano: Why Luca?
Mariano: Why does the boss want me dead?
Mariano: Tell me what is it that I’ve done to deserve this $and I won’t fight you anymore.
Mariano: I’m kinda dead anyways.
Luca: I love you Mariano.
Luca: I couldn’t have asked for a better brother.
Luca: But this is business, $and it’s hurting our weekly cap.
Mariano: BECAUSE OF WHAT!?
Mariano: I’ve always done things by the book $and I’ve never spoken against the boss.
Luca: It’s not that Mariano it’s about that fucking. . .
Luca: I don’t know if I can tell.
Mariano: Why can’t you tell?
Mariano: Just tell me and I will disappear.
Mariano: You can just say the job’s done when you get back.
Luca: YOU’RE SUPPOSED TO BE DEAD!
Luca: *sigh*
Luca: You know you'll never get it from me friend.
Mariano: Regardless of if you tell me or not $I’m going to figure it out myself.
Mariano: Then trust me, you won’t ever find me again.
Mariano: Farewell Luca.
