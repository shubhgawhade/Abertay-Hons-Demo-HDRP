Mariano: There's a guy's ashes in this, he was a snake, a rat apparently, the reason feds never stopped looking into us. $We had had to keep looking over our shoulders ever since. $Luca and a few others put him in a furnace, alive. Now he's a reminder to never disobey the oath we took. $Also he was Paulie's brother, the difference between the two, jeez, it's day and night. Paulie had to work real hard to prove his loyalty and that;s why I respect him a lot, it wasn't easy on him trust me, some folk treated him like his brother Alfie and made rat cracks.
